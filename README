This is a online GPS tracking system based on using mobile phones with embedded GPS chips. Java client also support using external GPS sources via Bluetooth. Server is totally written on Erlang + MySQL database as data storage. Server supports geofence (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geofence), reverse geocoding (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_geocoding), triggers based on events:
* client enters area
* client leaves area
* client become online
* client become offline
* periodical position reporting

Trigger events can be sent by SMS, eMail and also can be reported to Twitter. Text of such messages support templates with substitution of useful data.
